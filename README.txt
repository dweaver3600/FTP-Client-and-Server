Programming Language:	C++

How to execute the program:
	These codes do not seem to work as executable files. Please use Visual Studio or some other IDE to run them.

	1) Run the server code FIRST
	2) Run the Client code. The client will connect to the server automatically


Server Terminal window:
	running server.cpp will create a server with the localhost ip and an unoccupied socket

Client Terminal window:
	running client.cpp will open a client that will automatically connect to the server

COMMANDS
	ls		returns all file names in the server directory
	get [filename]	copies a file from server directory to client directory
	put [filename]	copies a file from client directory to server directory
	quit		quits the program

NOTE:
	Some text files have been included to use with the server and client for the PUT and GET commands
